## Key Insights:

2009 saw an extreme spike in E. Coli counts – could be due to testing anomalies or environmental events (remains a red flag).
Summer months (May–August) see a noticeable increase in E. Coli – just as people are flocking to beaches!
Weekends show consistently higher E. Coli levels – possibly due to increased human activity or delayed water sampling.
Sunnyside Beach often has higher average E. Coli levels than Marie Curtis Park – something to consider for your next beach day.
